# Starwake

A Fabric overhaul mod for Minecraft, inspired by No Man's Sky: fly between procedurally
generated planets, live in a walkable starship, trade with faction NPCs, and climb a
fuel/upgrade/crafting progression.

> Named **Starwake** (2026-11-10), replacing the working title "Starbound Frontier",
> which clashed with an existing game. The **mod id is `starwake`** and must never change:
> changing it would orphan every saved block and item. The GitHub repo keeps the name `starfront`.

## Pinned versions (do not change without a migration plan)

| Component | Version | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Minecraft | **26.3** ("Wilderness Bound", released 2026-09-15) | Latest stable that Fabric API fully supports. 26.4 is still in snapshots. |
| Java | **25** | Required by Minecraft 26.x. |
| Fabric Loader | 0.20.1 | |
| Fabric API | 0.166.0+26.3 | |
| Fabric Loom | 1.19-SNAPSHOT (plugin id `net.fabricmc.fabric-loom`) | 26.x is unobfuscated, so there is **no mappings line**. We code against Mojang's real names (`Level`, `BlockPos`, `ResourceKey`...). |
| Gradle | 9.8.2 (wrapper) | |

These match Fabric's official example mod template for 26.3. Upgrade only between
milestones, as a single dedicated commit.

## Architecture

### Source layout (Loom split source sets)

```
src/main/java/...      common + server logic (runs on both sides)
src/client/java/...    client-only: rendering, screens, input, sky, HUD
src/main/resources     fabric.mod.json, data/ (datapack), assets/ shared resources
src/main/generated     datagen output (models, lang, loot tables, recipes) - committed
```

`splitEnvironmentSourceSets()` makes it a **compile error** for common code to touch
client classes. This is our main guard for keeping multiplayer possible.

### Package layout (organised by system)

├── StarwakeClient          client entrypoint
├── datagen/                data generators (need client classes for models)
├── render/  screen/  sky/  hud/
```

### Principles

1. **Server-authoritative.** The client sends intents ("launch ship", "buy item") and the
   server validates and applies them. The client never decides outcomes.
2. **Data-driven first.** Planet types, star classes, factions, trade tables, ore
   distributions, fuel values and ship modules live in JSON (datapack, dynamic
   registries, or codecs) so they can be tweaked without recompiling. Java defines
   *behaviour*; JSON defines *content and numbers*.
3. **Deterministic procedural generation.** Everything procedural derives from
   `(world seed, galaxy coordinates)` through a stable hash, so the server and every
   client agree and nothing has to be stored until a player changes it.
4. **No heavy per-tick work.** Prefer events, cached values, attribute modifiers and
   lazy computation. Per-tick logic must be O(1) per player or entity, or amortised.
5. **Prefer vanilla mechanisms over mixins.** For example, gravity uses the vanilla
   `gravity` / `safe_fall_distance` / `jump_strength` attributes. When a mixin is
   unavoidable, keep it small, comment why it exists, and isolate it in a `mixin`
   package for that system.
6. **Verify APIs against real sources.** Read the decompiled 26.3 sources (`genSources`)
   or Fabric's docs before using an API. Don't guess names.

## Build-vs-depend decisions

Research done 2026-11-10. None of the big space/ship mods ships for 26.3, so we can
only learn from them, not depend on them.

| System | Reference mod | Status | Decision |
|---|---|---|---|
| Walkable moving ship | Valkyrien Skies 2; Create Aeronautics (built on the Sable physics library) | VS: official 1.20.1 only (unofficial port: 1.21.11). Aeronautics/Sable: NeoForge 1.21.1, custom license. | **Build.** Neither can run on Fabric 26.3. Learn from the "shipyard/sub-level" idea: ship blocks live in a reserved region of the world and are rendered and collided at the ship's transform. See decision A. |
| Planets, rockets, gravity, oxygen | Ad Astra | Latest Fabric build is 1.21.1 | **Build.** Learn from its data-driven planet JSON (gravity, temperature, oxygen, tier) and its rocket flow (fly up, threshold altitude, destination screen). |
| Space progression | Galacticraft 5 | Pre-alpha, no release | **Build.** Use only as a reference for Fabric transfer/energy patterns. |
| Runtime dimensions (one per procedural planet) | NucleoidMC **Fantasy** | Supports 26.3 (v0.8.4, LGPL-3.0) | **Depend (decided).** Creating and unloading dimensions at runtime is fiddly mixin work that Fantasy already maintains. Bundle it with jar-in-jar. Needs the `maven.nucleoid.xyz` host allowed in the environment. See decision B. |
| Items, blocks, networking, menus, datagen, game tests | Fabric API | 26.3 | **Depend.** |

---

## Decisions

- **A. Ship = a real moving block structure (decided 2026-11-10).** The user wants it to
  work like Create Aeronautics: the ship you build is real blocks, persistent with the rest
  of the world, and you walk around inside it while it flies. There's **no pocket
  dimension**. The planned approach (to be researched in detail before Milestone 4) is a
  "sub-level": the ship's blocks are stored in a reserved far-away region of the same
  dimension as normal saved chunks. A ship entity holds the transform (position/rotation).
  The client renders that region at the transform, and the server handles collision so
  players standing on board move with the ship. Highest-risk system: prototype it early.
- **B. Planets = runtime dimensions via Fantasy (decided 2026-11-10)**, with **curated
  randomness** ("less random to make it more random"). Don't use raw noise soup. Each
  planet is a hand-authored *archetype* (lush, frozen, toxic, barren, ocean...) defined in
  JSON with palettes, terrain shapes, biome sets, ore tables and sky styles. The seed picks
  an archetype and varies parameters *within* designed ranges. Variety comes from
  structured combinations, so every planet feels deliberate and distinct.
  Milestone 2 uses one static datapack dimension; Milestone 5 swaps in Fantasy.

## Milestones

Work on one milestone at a time. After each: build, run, fix, summarize how to test,
commit. **Don't start the next milestone until the user confirms the current one works.**

- [x] **1. Scaffold.** The mod loads, with one test block (Hull Plating) and one test
      item (Raw Ferrite), a creative tab, datagen for models/lang/loot/tags, and a
      dedicated server that boots cleanly. *(Verified on server + client 2026-11-10;
      awaiting user playtest confirmation.)*
- [x] **2. First planet.** Veyra: a static datapack dimension with its own sky (teal sky,
      dusty fog, daytime stars, ash particles, 40-minute day), 0.45g gravity, and dry
      rust-world terrain with Ferrite Ore. Reachable with `/starwake planet tp starwake:veyra`
      and `/starwake planet leave`. *(Verified on server + client 2026-11-10; awaiting user
      playtest.)*
- [ ] **3. Rocket.** A rocket entity with a launch sequence that travels to the
      planet and back.
- [ ] **4. Walkable ship.** A built block structure that moves as a ship, persistent
      in the world (decision A).
- [ ] **5. Procedural planets.** Terrain, biomes and ores seeded by galaxy
      coordinates (decision B).
- [ ] **6. Star map.** A galaxy/star map UI for choosing seeded destinations.
- [ ] **7. Trading.** NPCs with factions, pricing and trade GUIs.
- [ ] **8. Progression.** Fuel, upgrades and crafting chains.
- [ ] **9. Polish.** Performance, multiplayer sync, config, balance.

## How planets work (Milestone 2)

A planet is a set of JSON files. Copy Veyra's and rename them to add one:

| File | Controls |
|---|---|
| `data/starwake/starwake/planet/<id>.json` | Starwake's planet registry: display name, dimension, `gravity` (multiplier) |
| `data/starwake/dimension/<id>.json` | Chunk generator, noise settings and biome source |
| `data/starwake/dimension_type/<id>.json` | Sky/fog/cloud colours, ambient particles, music, bed rules, height (vanilla *environment attributes*) |
| `data/starwake/world_clock/<id>.json` + `timeline/<id>_day.json` | Day length and the sky's day/night curve (sun angle, star brightness, sunset colour) |
| `data/starwake/worldgen/noise_settings/<id>.json` | Terrain shape (Veyra reuses Overworld density functions with no water, so oceans become dry basins) |
| `data/starwake/worldgen/material_rule/<id>.json` | Surface blocks |
| `data/starwake/worldgen/biome/*.json`, `feature/`, `placed_feature/` | Biomes, ores, decorations |

Code: `planet/Planets` (registry plus O(1) dimension index), `planet/PlanetGravity`
(transient attribute modifiers on entity load or level change, no per-tick work),
`planet/PlanetTravel` (teleport plus persistent return point, reused by the rocket in
Milestone 3) and `planet/PlanetCommands`.

**Not yet:** custom sky objects (other planets or moons hanging in the sky) need a client
renderer, planned for Milestone 5 or 6. Non-living entities (items, arrows) still fall at
normal gravity.

## 26.3 gotchas (learned the hard way)

- **Every solid block must be in `#minecraft:blocks_motion_no_leaves`.** In 26.3,
  heightmaps, ore placement, suffocation, fluid flow and teleport targets use this tag,
  not the block's shape. Without it, worldgen treats the block as hollow (our ores
  silently never generated). `ModBlockTagProvider` adds every `ModBlocks` entry.
- **The day/night cycle is data.** `world_clock` + `timeline` registries replace hardcoded
  time. Query a planet's time with `/time query starwake:veyra_day`; set it with
  `/time of starwake:veyra set <ticks>`.
- **Biome environment attributes take a plain value**, e.g.
  `"minecraft:gameplay/natural_mob_spawns": {"spawn_costs": {}, "spawns_by_category": {}}`.
  The `{"argument", "modifier"}` form also requires `modifier`.
- **Worldgen registries were renamed:** `worldgen/feature` (not `configured_feature`), and
  surface rules live in the `worldgen/material_rule` registry.
- `/place feature <ore>` fails on already-generated chunks (it needs worldgen heightmaps).
  Test ores by generating fresh chunks and counting with `/fill ... replace`.

## Dev workflow

```bash
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-25-openjdk-amd64   # cloud container; locally any JDK 25
./gradlew build          # compile + jar -> build/libs/
./gradlew runDatagen     # regenerate src/main/generated (commit the output)
./gradlew runClient      # dev client (playtest)
./gradlew runServer      # dedicated server: verifies the mod loads without client code
./gradlew genSources     # decompiled MC sources, for checking real API names
```

### Testing in the cloud container (no GPU)

- **Server:** create `run/eula.txt` (`eula=true`) and `run/server.properties`
  (`online-mode=false`), then `./gradlew runServer --args=--nogui`. Feed console commands
  through a FIFO (`setblock`, `execute if block`, `loot spawn ... mine ...`) and stop with `stop`.
- **Client:** OpenGL fails on Xvfb ("Couldn't find matching GLX visual"), but Minecraft
  26.x falls back to **Vulkan on Mesa lavapipe** (`mesa-vulkan-drivers`), which works.
  Run `xvfb-run -n 99 -f <auth> -s "-screen 0 1280x720x24 +extension GLX" ./gradlew runClient`
  with `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` set. Drive the client with `xdotool` (`t` opens chat, then type
  commands) and capture with `import -window root shot.png`.
- Authlib "Services are unavailable" stack traces are expected offline and harmless.
- **Never `unset JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS`.** It carries the proxy settings Gradle needs.

### Cloud environment

The `starfront` environment allows `maven.fabricmc.net`, `meta.fabricmc.net`, the Fabric
docs, and Mojang's download hosts. Its setup script installs `openjdk-25-jdk-headless`
(and the client-testing tools: `mesa-vulkan-drivers`, `xdotool`).
New dependency hosts, such as `maven.nucleoid.xyz` for Fantasy, must be added to the
environment before they work.

## Conventions

- Java 25 language features are fine: records, sealed types, pattern matching.
- Mod id `starwake`. Every registry id is lowercase_snake (`starwake:hull_plating`).
- Register through the helpers in `registry/` (they apply `setId`, which 26.x requires).
- Lang, models, loot and tags come from datagen (`src/client/java/.../datagen`). Don't
  hand-edit `src/main/generated`. Textures in `src/main/resources/assets` are hand-made.
- Every class gets a short header comment explaining its role in its system.
- Commit after every working milestone. Message format: `M<n>: <summary>`.
- **Deliver a jar every milestone:** `./gradlew build`, then send `build/libs/starwake-<ver>.jar`
  to the user. CI (`.github/workflows/build.yml`) also uploads the jar as an artifact on every push.
- Bump `mod_version` in `gradle.properties` per milestone (0.<milestone>.0).
- In the cloud container, don't block on long waits: start servers and clients in the
  background and poll with short, bounded loops.
